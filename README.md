# 🐾 PetClinic – Academic Contributions 2024/25

This repository documents my technical contributions to a group project developed at the University of Seville as part of the course **“Software Process and Management II”**, structured around a **React + Java Spring Boot** architecture.

The original repository is hosted in a **private organization (`gii-is-psg2`)**, but this space serves to highlight my main technical deliverable: the implementation of a **complete end-to-end pet adoption feature**.

---

## 🔧 Implemented Features

### ✅ Backend – Pet Adoption Request System

Developed using **Java and Spring Boot**:

- 📦 **Entity:** `ApplicationRequest` to manage adoption flow between owners and applicants.
- ⚙️ **Service & Controller layers:** endpoints for creating, retrieving, accepting, and rejecting adoption requests.
- 🔁 **State management:** implemented request lifecycle states: `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`.
- 🔐 **Role-based access control (RBAC):** restricted operations based on user roles (owner vs adopter).

---

## 🖥️ Frontend (React)

- Built an adoption request submission form.
- Owner-side view for managing incoming applications.
- Action buttons for accepting or rejecting requests.
- Real-time state synchronization with backend logic.
